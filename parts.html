      <p>Frame.</p>
      <p>A 5″ Quadcopter Frame is typically considered a “Mini-Quad”. This is the most common size that people use for FPV racing and freestyle flight. A quad-copter's frame is the skeleton of the system. Everything connects to it as the base.</p>

        <p>Flight controller.</p>
        <p>Flight controller is capable of computing the speed of each of the four motors, and then it sends a signal to the Electronic Speed Controllers or ESCs. This facilitates a smoother flight.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
        <p>Motors.</p>
        <p>For the vast majority of the circumstances, knowing frame size allows us to estimate what kind of motor we should use. This is on the grounds that the frame size limits props size, and prop measurement limits the motor size and KV.</p>

    <div class="col-sm">
        <p>Propellers.</p>
        <p>FPV Drone Propellers are the key component that keeps your multirotor in the air, they have the most direct impact on how your machine flies, and over the lifetime of your multirotor they are likely to add up to be the biggest investment that you make to keep flying.</p>
