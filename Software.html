          <li><p>Betaflight.</p>
              <p>Crossplatform configuration tool for Betaflight flight control system.
                  Allows you to configure your aircraft via a GUI.</p></li>
          <li><p>Raceflight.</p>
              <p>Raceflight, unlike Betaflight, is completely proprietary and developed behind closed doors. This can be seen as both a pro or a con. Itâ€™s a good thing because there is a set vision for where the firmware is supposed to go, and the team is working to reach that goal.</p></li>
          <li><p>PX4.</p>
              <p>PX4 is used in a wide range of use-cases, from consumer drones to industrial applications. It is also the leading research platform for drones and has been successfully applied to under water vehicles and boats.</p></li>
          <li><p>Ground control.</p>
              <p>QGroundControl provides full flight control and mission planning for any MAVLink enabled drone. Its primary goal is ease of use for professional users and developers. All the code is open-source source, so you can contribute and evolve it as you want.</p></li>
          <li><p>OpenTX.</p>
              <p>OpenTX is open source firmware for RC radio transmitters. The firmware is highly configurable and brings much more features than found in traditional radios. The daily feedback from the thousands of users ensures the continued stability and quality of the firmware.</p></li>
